# Problem
Read the input one line at a time. At any point after reading the first 42 lines, if some line is blank (i.e., a string of length 0), then output the line that occured 42 lines prior to that one. For example, if Line 242 is blank, then your program should output line 200. This program should be implemented so that it never stores more than 43 lines of the input at any given time.
