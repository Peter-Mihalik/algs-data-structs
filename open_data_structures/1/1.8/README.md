# Problem 
Read the entire input one line at a time and then output the even numbered lines (starting with the first line, line 0) followed by the odd-numbered lines. 

# Implementation notes
- I have made up my mind about using fileHandler class that will hold file stream logic
- I have implemented all the logic as private members and constructor just calls all the main logic member functions
- I feel like this makes the most of the encapsulation principle 
- I would like to move MyFileHandler up by one in file structure and refactor other solutions using this class
