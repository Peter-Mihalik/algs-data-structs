# General info
This exercise is designed to help familiarize the reader with choosing the right data structure for the right problem. If implemented, the parts of this exercise should be done by making use of an implementation of the relevant interface ( Stack}, Queue, Deque, USet, or SSet) provided by the C++ Standard Template Library.

Solve the following problems by reading a text file one line at a time and performing operations on each line in the appropriate data structure(s). Your implementations should be fast enough that even files containing a million lines can be processed in a few seconds. 

# Problem
Read the input one line at a time and then write the lines out in reverse order, so that the last input line is printed first, then the second last input line, and so on.
